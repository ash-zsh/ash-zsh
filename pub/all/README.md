# Welcome to the PGPark

Here lies all of my PGP keys, each named according to its expiration date. In case you need to link to the latest key, [a symlink](../latest.asc) is provided for exactly that.

For obvious security reasons, any commit which adds a new key is signed by the previously latest key.
